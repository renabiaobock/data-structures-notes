## Introduction
* What is a Data Structure?
A **data structure** is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
They help to manage and organize data.
They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

## Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures

### Abstract Data Type
An **abstract data type** is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does note give any specific details about how somethin should be implemented or in what programming language.

## Computational Complexity Analisys

How much **time** does this algorithm need to finish?
How much **space** does this algorith need for its comoutation?

### Big-O Notation

*n: input size*

Constant Time: O(1)
Logarithmic Time: O(log(n))
Linear Time: O(n)
Linearithmic Time: O(nlog(n))
Quadric Time: O(n²)
Cubic Time: O(n³)
Exponential Time: O(b^n), b > 1
Factorial Time: O(n!)
